# media-sort
Media sorting script to file types (Help appreciated)

Somewhat broken, especially -r/--rename option, also very much 0.1.

Default behavior is move files

Options are:

```-d/--date``` - Moves files to their filetype folders and renames the folder by date

```-c/--copy``` - Copies files instead of just moving them

```-r/--rename``` Renames files with the modified dates, very fucking broken, don't use. 

Usage: ```media-sort.bat --options "/path/to/directory" ```
